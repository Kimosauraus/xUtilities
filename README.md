**jUtilities** is a collection of various utilities and projects made with Java. This is a personal project made to document my progress in Java by applying ideas with it. Hence, it's a collection of utilities (tools) and projects. I separated the projects into four categories:
  
- **Beginner** - Easy to create and take short time.
- **Intermediate** - Somewhat hard to implement and takes a fair bit of time.
- **Advanced** - Hard to implement and takes a long time. These are projects I'm proud of.
- **Archive** - Houses very old projects.
