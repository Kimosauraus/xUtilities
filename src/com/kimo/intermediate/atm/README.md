# ATM #

Automated Teller Machine.

## What is this? ##

A simple ATM that allows you to create multiple banks and users, and for each user, you can create multiple accounts like Savings, Checking, etc. This project was made by following [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0BofouWX-o) made by TechLiterate.

## How to use? ##

Firstly, make sure to create atleast a `Bank` and `User` object for this program to function correctly. Each account is initialized with a savings account but you might need to create a second account to test the transferring capabilities ;). The rest is obvious from the menu options. You can transfer, deposit, withdraw, print accounts summary and show transaction history for a certain account.
