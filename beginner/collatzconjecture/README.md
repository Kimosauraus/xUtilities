# CollatzConjecture #

Collatz conjecture algorithm.

## What is this? ##

A simple algorithm using a number as input. If the specified number is even, it divides it by 2. If the specified number is odd, it multiplies it by 3 and then add 1. This is repeated until the number reaches a value of 1. This program has the feature of returning the amount of steps it took to reach 1 and printing it out. 

## How to use? ##

Enter a valid number to run it through the algorithm. You can type `!q` anytime to exit the program.
